              <p><strong>Journal Articles: </strong></p>
              <p>A number of additional readings will be assigned each week. Articles/readings for the course will be located within the course itself or by accessing the articles through the A-Z Journal Locater (USA Library). Here are some instructions for accessing the articles through the A-Z Journal Locater:</p>
              <p><strong>Teaching Methods: </strong>Reading assignments, interprofessional collaborative discussion threads, written assignments, and experiential learning through development of a synthesis project.</p>
              <p><strong>Course Writing:</strong> All writing for this course (discussion board postings, emails and submitted assignments) should reflect the attributes of clarity, precision and power. Please check all work for errors in spelling, punctuation and mechanics before submission.  Please bring all errors in the course, or in any communication, to the attention of the course instructor.</p>
              <p>The voice of the writings on discussion board should be reflective and in the first person as if conducting a casual or scholarly conversation among colleagues and peers. All written assignments should be formal and in APA format.</p>
              <p><strong>Learning is not a top-down process. Each of us shares in the responsibility of educating and being educated. Students are expected to make positive contributions that foster a professional, analytic atmosphere.  Healthy debate is encouraged, but students must remain mindful that remarks that demean others and/or their opinions are not tolerated.</strong></p>

              <p><em>*See scoring rubrics for each graded assignment.</em></p>
              <p>All assignments are due by 11:00 p.m. Eastern on Sunday of the designated week.</p>
              <p>In case the server goes down and you cannot submit your assignments, there will be an extension of the assignment deadline. Assignments will normally be graded and returned within five to seven days. You will be e-mailed within 4 days of your unit assignment deadline if your assignment has not been received. If you do not hear from your instructor by four days, assume that your assignment was received. Physical attendance in a live classroom is not expected for this online course. It is expected, however, that the learner completes all designed learning experiences in both a timely and professional manner as identified in the course syllabus and as supported through asynchronous communications. In general, each unit is formatted to be completed in a weekly manner. The primary course interface will occur in an asynchronous manner through the use of course e-mail and discussion boards.</p>
              <p>The instructor will visit e-mail on a daily basis. As a general rule, a response by the instructor to a query from the learner will be generated in less than 48 hours, if not sooner. In most cases assignments will be graded within 48 hours; lengthier assignments may take up to 7 days to grade.
              </p>

              <p><strong>You have 15 weeks to complete the entire course, including the final synthesis paper. </strong>If you should need an extension due to illness, tragedy or unforeseen circumstances, please contact your instructor. You may of course complete it sooner, or as quickly as you wish.</p>
              <p>All work should be completed by the end of the course, otherwise you will receive an “incomplete”. You will have 15 weeks to complete the missing assignments (if your extension is approved by a program director).  If the work remains incomplete at the end of the 15-week extension your transcript will show an “F”. There are no further extensions.</p>
              <p>Students must complete at least one assignment within the first three weeks of the start date. If this is not possible, there must be email communication with the instructor during this period of time. Should neither of these two things take place, the student will be automatically withdrawn from the course, with the tuition placed in funds on hold (minus tuition kept by the University as stated in the refund policy). In certain cases, an extension may be granted. Please contact your instructor with any extension requests.</p>
              <p>You can access your final grade and unofficial transcript by logging into my.usa.edu on the home page of the website.   If you have misplaced your password that was assigned to you from the registrar’s office, please click on “forgot my password” a new password will be assigned to you and emailed to you.   No grades are mailed out.</p>

              <h3>Professional  Behaviors </h3>
              <h5>Late  Assignments: </h5>
              <p>Learners are responsible for all missed or  incomplete work. Late assignments may be subject to a 20% penalty every 24  hours period the assignment is tardy and the instructor reserves the right to  deduct additional points if the assignment is overdue beyond the initial 24  hour tardy period.

              <h5>Academic Integrity: </h5>
              <p>The University recognizes the  principles of honesty and truth as fundamental to ethical business dealings and  to a vibrant academic community of faculty and students.

The work that a  student submits shall be a fair representation of his/her ability, knowledge  and skill. The University expects students to respect and exhibit these  principles as they form the basis of the quality of the institution and the  quality of USAHS&rsquo;s graduates. The academic  integrity policy is clearly defined in the student handbook. Penalties for not  following this policy could range from a zero on an assignment to dismissal  from the University.</p>
              <h5>Plagiarism and Citation of Sources: </h5>
              <p>Academic  honesty is expected of all students. It is expected that all student work will  be that of the student&rsquo;s, or it will be cited with a source if it is the work  of another author or scholar. Plagiarism occurs when a student uses another person&rsquo;s  ideas or words without properly citing the source of that material. A graduate  student it is expected to have to properly cite their sources and to know what  constitutes plagiarism.

              <h5>Self-Citation:</h5>
              <p>When students use their own work in subsequent course assignments, the citation must be formatted with the student as a primary author and previous coursework as unpublished papers.</p>
              <p><strong>Note: </strong>Instructors are trained to detect work that does not appear to be the original work of a student. This is done through the use of web search engines or library database tools as well as any number of plagiarism detection applications. If a student is found to have submitted a plagiarized work the result may be a failing mark for the assignment. Additionally, the faculty member may report the offense to university administration for further action as found in the universities policies on academic dishonesty.</p>
